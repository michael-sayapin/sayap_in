Hi, I'm Michael!

I got my first computer in 1990, when I was 6. While my friends played Quake, I was trying to disassemble it.

I worked in e-Commerce and managed a team of 14. In 2009, I moved to China and founded my own web store selling to 700,000+ customers. I've always been passionate about weight lifting and nutrition, so later I founded another startup that builds customized athletic meal plans from delivery food.

Since 2022 I'm based in Bangkok, but work consulting a slew of global startups from Ukraine, Singapore, US, UK, and China on all things Kubernetes, scalability, DBA, DevOps, and system architecture.

I love cooking Chinese and global food and manage 20+ dish Lunar New Year lunches for my extended Chinese family. I'm also passionate about Chinese tea, hydroponic gardening, home building, beer brewing, bread baking, biking, 3D printing, CNC, and good pipe tobacco.

Happy to connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-sayapin/) or by email `michael [at] sayap.in`.
